2. Branching and Merging: Allows creation of branches for isolated development and merging them back into the main codebase.
3. Distributed System: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history.
4. Command-Line Interface (CLI): Primarily operated through CLI commands, although graphical interfaces are available.
5. Open Source: Developed as an open-source project and freely available.
