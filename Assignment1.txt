What is Git?
Git is a ditributed version control system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to track changes in source code during software development. Its key features are :
1. Version Control: Manages and tracks changes to files, enabling developers to revert to previous states and view history.
2. Branching and Merging: Allows creation of branches for isolated development and merging them back into the main codebase.
3. Distributed System: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history.
4. Command-Line Interface (CLI): Primarily operated through CLI commands, although graphical interfaces are available.
5. Open Source: Developed as an open-source project and freely available.

What is github?
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides a collaborative environment for developers.Some of its key features are :
1. Repository Hosting: Hosts Git repositories, allowing developers to share code over the internet.
2. Collaboration Tools: Includes features like pull requests, code reviews, issue tracking, and project management.
3. Social Coding: Encourages social interaction among developers with features like followers, stars, and forks.
4. Integrated Services: Provides CI/CD integration, project boards, wikis, and pages for documentation.
5. Web Interface: Offers a graphical user interface for managing repositories, viewing commits, and collaborating.

Summary of Differences
Functionality:

Git: A version control system for tracking changes in code.
GitHub: A platform for hosting Git repositories and facilitating collaboration with additional features.
Nature:

Git: Local tool installed on a developer’s machine.
GitHub: Online service accessible via a web browser.
Operations:

Git: Command-line based operations for version control.
GitHub: Web-based interface for managing repositories and collaborating.
Collaboration:

Git: Supports collaboration but requires a shared repository; no inherent web interface.
GitHub: Built-in tools for collaboration, including web-based interfaces for pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews.
Accessibility:

Git: Can be used without internet access; only local operations require no connectivity.
GitHub: Requires internet access to interact with repositories hosted on GitHub.
Example Workflow
With Git Alone:

Developer clones a repository from a central server (if available).
Makes changes locally and commits them to their local repository.
Shares changes by pushing to a shared repository or by other means.
With Git and GitHub:

Developer clones a repository from GitHub.
Makes changes locally and commits them.
Pushes changes to GitHub, where other developers can review and merge them.
Uses GitHub’s web interface for discussions, issue tracking, and collaboration.
